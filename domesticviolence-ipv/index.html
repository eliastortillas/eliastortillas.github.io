		<h1>The number of NYC job centers corresponds with rate of intimate partner violence.</h1>
		<h2>Approximately 70% of victims and perpetrators of intimate partner felony assaults had contact with NYC Human Resources Administration within the past 12 months. This map and other visualizations represent the Human Resources Administration job centers and the rate of intimate partner violence reports classified at felony assault in 2018.</h2>

		<p> On this map you can see that the job centers (the red points) often correspond with the community districts with higher levels of intimate partner violence (indicated by darker shades of blue). This might be indicative of a pattern observed by the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV).</p>

		<p> According to a 2019 report from ENDGBV approximately 70% of victims (84 of 120) and 68% of perpetrators (84 of 123) in 2015-2018 had contact with Human Resources Administration for services including cash assistance, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, and Medicaid in the 12 months prior to the homicide. </p>

		<p>Based on this information, is it possible that contact with Human Resources Administration corresponds with higher rates of intimate partner violence?</p>

		<p>According to the above map: maybe. It’s hard to tell. Community District 1 in Bronx (Bronx 1) has almost the highest rate of intimate partner violence and has a job center. This is also true of Bronx 2 and Brooklyn 5. But Bronx 3 has the very highest rate of intimate partner violence but does not have a job center. Brooklyn 2 has three job centers and has is 34 out of 59 in rate of intimate partner violence. </p>

		<div class="mychart">
			<iframe title="Intimate partner felony assault rate and number of job centers by community district" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-IaClv" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IaClv/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="563"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
		</div>

		<p> Out of the 20 community districts with the highest rates of assault only 10 of them had job centers: just half. These numbers seem to contradict the pattern suggested in the map. </p>

		<p>But if you study the map a similar pattern is that community district with lower rates of partner violence tend not to have a job center. The 20 community districts with the lowest rates of assault have only 2 job centers. The following graph shows the number of job centers on the horizontal axis and a positive relationship with partner violence rate on the vertical axis. </p>

		<div class="mychart">
			<iframe title="Do more job centers predict higher rate of intimate partner violence?" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-hE7Vu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hE7Vu/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
		</div>

		<p>The same relationship is more pronounced when Brooklyn 2 is removed which has three job center. Brooklyn 2 includes Downtown Brooklyn, DUMBO, and Brooklyn Heights. </p>

		<div class="mychart_skinny">
			<iframe title="" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-huYWq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/huYWq/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
		</div>

		<p>With any statistical test it is impossible to say how significant the relationship is. Statistical significance aside there appears to be a pattern that higher rates of partner violence correspond with greater number of job centers.</p>

		<p>There is no reason to believe this is causation. Both indices could independently result from other factors such as population, income, employment or any other factors (eg. low employment could cause a greater need for job centers as well as increase the rate of intimate partner violence). </p>

		<p>ENDGBV commented that their data only provides the levels of domestic violence and does not provide analysis. They also commented that domestic violence and gender-based violence are generally underreported. </p>
