		<h1>Brooklyn and The Bronx have worst rates of rape and domestic violence in NYC</h1>
		<h2>The two boroughs have the worst rates of rape and domestic violence based on data from 2017-2018 released by the mayor's office. They do not appear related to reported rates of other crimes.</h2>
		<h3>Elias M. Guerra</h3>

		<p> <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/crime-down-nyc-rape-glaring-exception/">WNYC</a> reported in January that while all crimes have gone down, reports of rape have gone up. They attribute this mostly to greater trust and historic underreporting. But the distribution of reports of rape is not the same per borough, even accounting for population.</p>

		<p>The Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence released a report in 2018 on reports of felony assault and rape, domestic and family-related. Of this data set I analyzed family-related felony assault and domestic violence-related rape. </p>

		<div class="mychart">
			<iframe title="Felony assault and rape by borough in New York City in 2017-2018" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-XPe6c" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XPe6c/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="469"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
		</div>

		<p>For both reported crimes Brooklyn and The Bronx combined made up almost two-thirds of all reports (59% and 67% respectively). Staten Island has by far the lowest rates of assault and rape (less than 5% each). </p>

		<p>In a comparison of the rates of assault and rape it appears there is a strong connection. The size of circles shows the rate of felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes in 2018 but there is no obvious relationship. </p>

		<div class="mychart">
			<iframe title="Felony assault compared to rape in New York City 2017-2018" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-cDgyi" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cDgyi/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="605"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
		</div>

		<p> The neighborhoods with the worst rates of assault and rape were Mott Haven (Bronx 1), Hunts Point (Bronx 2), Brownsville (Brooklyn 16) and East New York (Brooklyn 5). The neighborhood with the worst crime was, perhaps unexpectedly, actually the business district (Manhattan 5). Park Slope (Brooklyn 6), Chelsea (Manhattan 4), and Tribeca (Manhattan 1) also have very high rates of crime while East New York has some of the lowest rates of crime. If crime statistics was divided up by felony and misdemeanors it is possible there might be some relationship that was missed in this analysis. </p>
