		<h1>Free Wi-Fi Comes to the South Bronx</h1>
		<h2>The POINT CDC is trying to bring free weather-resistant internet to the South Bronx</h2>

		<p>Gilberto Romero and Luis Saula-Guasco are organizing data in a spreadsheet for the free Wi-Fi project in the small office above The POINT Community Development Corporation (CDC) in Hunts Point, Bronx. Outside, on the roof are the nodes that share The POINT's internet with other buildings free of charge. Providing internet for free is not the primary goal of the project. They are creating a wireless mesh network that would be resilient in an extreme weather event such as a Hurricane. </p>

		<p>In 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the east coast. It cost New York City 19 billion dollars, according to DNAinfo. Millions of people lost power in NYC. In Red Hook, Brooklyn, cell phone service was down and the lights were out, according to the New York Times. But the wireless mesh network, that had only recently been set up, was still operating. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) boosted the broadband for the mesh network to enhance communication. The Hurricane provided a test for the network and demonstrated its utility as a resilient means of communication. </p>

		<p> In 2015, the New York City Environmental Development Corporation (NYCEDC) held a competition, RISE: NYC, for innovative technologies that could make the city more resilient in extreme weather events. The non-profit New America was one of the competition winners with the wireless mesh network project. This network works by sending internet from one building with a wired connection to another buildings. The nodes, which are located on the rooftops, then transmit the internet connection throughout the building via Wi-Fi. </p>

		<p>The physical infrastructure is only part of the project. The other essential component is digital stewardship. Yamil Lora heads the free Wi-Fi project at The POINT and has trained over 60 digital stewards, including Romero and Saula-Guasco. He explains that it is better to train locals because in an extreme weather event it would not be realistic to expect anyone to reach the area immediately. Also, training locals to build and maintain the network fosters a sense of ownership, Lora says. </p>

		<p>Romero joined the project two years ago. He says it is a really exciting time to be working on the free Wi-Fi project. They were learning and talking about creating a wireless mesh network when he started. Now they are actually building the mesh network. In 2018, The POINT received a five hundred thousand dollar grant from Citi Foundation for the Free Wi-Fi project and this past summer they began transmitting internet to personal residences. </p>

		<p>One resident receiving free Wi-Fi, Julian Lamb, said the service actually served him as intended. In the first week of September Optimum customers experienced an overnight power outage. Lamb said in his home when the internet went out he used the mesh network. While he did find the service useful, Lamb says he does not foresee the service immediately replacing his current internet as he cannot connect certain devices.</p>

		<p>To an outsider the project might seem overly ambitious or rushed. But Yamil says,</p>

 		<p>"I'm just taking it one step at a time. You crimp one cable and then you plug it in. Then you connect one house. Then you connect four houses. Then you connect the block."</p>
